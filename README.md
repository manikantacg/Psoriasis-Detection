                   Automated Detection of Psoriasis Stages
This project aims to automate the detection of stages in psoriasis using image processing and machine learning techniques. 
The system takes skin images as input, processes them to remove noise and distortions, and then uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the stages of psoriasis. 
Based on the classification, the system recommends treatments such as topical therapy, phototherapy, or biologics.

Prerequisites:

1)Python 3.x
2)OpenCV
3)NumPy
4)TensorFlow/Keras
5)Scikit-learn
6)Installation


To install the required libraries, run: 
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow scikit-learn

Usage

Preprocess Images: Apply image processing techniques to clean and prepare the images.

Train ANN: Use the processed images to train an Artificial Neural Network.

Predict Psoriasis Stage: Use the trained model to predict the stage of psoriasis and recommend treatment.

Steps:
1)Image Preprocessing

* Convert images to grayscale.
* Apply Canny edge detection.
* Find and draw contours.

2)Training the ANN

* Create a dataset of images and corresponding labels.
* Define and compile the neural network.
* Train the network with the dataset.


3)Prediction

* Load the trained model.
* Predict the stage of psoriasis for new images.



Notes

* Replace "path_to_image1.jpg", "path_to_image2.jpg", etc., with the actual paths to your images.
  
* Adjust the ANN architecture and training parameters as needed.
  
* Ensure that the labels correspond to the actual stages of psoriasis in your dataset.
  
* This script provides a basic framework for the automated detection of psoriasis stages. You can enhance the model and preprocessing steps based on your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.
